# matrix-archive

This is the archive of the decision matrix for version 5 of Distrochooser.de.

The intention for this dump is to allow developers to experiment with the project without having to create an own matrix.

## Importing:

See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-loaddata for details (the backend relies on an old version, but the dumping and loading should work).

## Disclaimer:

- **Please note that the licensing differs from the distrochooser/distrochooser repository**
- **Please note that the matrix is only working for the version 5 of the project, upcoming versions might deprecate it entirely**

## A plea

Even this dump could be utilized to create a copy of the project please consider contributing to distrochooser/distrochooser instead. Thank you :)
